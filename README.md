# Northcoders News API

For instructions, please head over to [L2C NC News].
You will need to create two .env files for your project: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names). Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.

Northcoders News API README
Overview
Northcoders News API is a backend project designed to simulate a real-world API service, similar to platforms like Reddit. It allows developers to programmatically access and manipulate data related to articles, comments, users, and topics.

This project utilizes PostgreSQL for the database and Node.js with the node-postgres library to interact with the database.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/northcoders-news-api.git
cd northcoders-news-api
Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Environment Configuration
You need to create two .env files in the root directory:

.env.test
.env.development
These files should define the database URL for your PostgreSQL instance. Example:

makefile
Copy code
PGDATABASE=your_database_name
Ensure your test database and development database are configured correctly in these files.

Database Setup
To set up the database schema and seed it with test data, run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
npm run setup-dbs
npm run seed
Run Tests
To verify that everything is working as expected, run the test suite:

bash
Copy code
npm test
Minimum Requirements
Node.js: v16.0.0 or higher
PostgreSQL: v12.0 or higher
Project Workflow
Create a new branch for each feature using:
bash
Copy code
git checkout -b <branch-name>
Push your branch to GitHub:
bash
Copy code
git push origin <branch-name>
Make a pull request (PR) for code review.
Once merged, switch back to main and pull the latest changes:
bash
Copy code
git checkout main
git pull origin main
